**Status**: DRAFT  
**Version**: 0.1.0 (Draft)  
**Category**: Extension Standard (Optional)

---

## Overview

The **Open Accessibility Contract (OAC)** is an optional extension standard that defines normative accessibility obligations and an evidence model for UI components and interactions.

OAC enables systems to declare, verify, and enforce accessibility requirements in a vendor-neutral, implementation-independent way. It preserves the **semantic meaning** of accessibility obligations across different UI frameworks and assistive technologies.

---

## Problem Statement

Modern accessible systems require:

- **Declarative accessibility requirements** that are implementation independent
- **Evidence-based compliance verification** across teams and tools
- **Semantic preservation** of accessibility obligations in distributed systems
- **Interoperable accessibility metadata** for UI components
- **Governance** of accessibility obligations and exceptions

---

## Maturity

OAC is **DRAFT** for v0.0.1. Breaking changes are allowed. Schemas may tighten further in minor or major releases.

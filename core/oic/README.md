# Open Intent Contract (OIC)

**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Status**: DRAFT  
**Scope**: Declarative intent semantics for AI-native systems

---

## Overview

The Open Intent Contract (OIC) defines a vendor-neutral contract for declaring intent in AI-native systems. OIC preserves the purpose, expectations, constraints, and allowed transitions of reasoning and action across agents, models, and runtimes.

---

## Purpose

OIC ensures that intent is explicit, portable, and machine-interpretable. It prevents intent drift when tasks move between agents, runtimes, or policy engines.

---

## Maturity

OIC is **DRAFT** for v0.0.1. Breaking changes are allowed. Schemas may tighten further in minor or major releases.

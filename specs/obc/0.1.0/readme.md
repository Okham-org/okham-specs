# OBC — Open Business Contract

**Status**: DRAFT  
**Version**: 0.1.0 (Draft)  
**Category**: Extension Standard (Optional)

---

## Overview

The **Open Business Contract (OBC)** is an optional extension standard that enables declarative business flow composition and orchestration with semantic meaning preservation.

OBC allows systems to define, compose, and execute business processes in a vendor-neutral, implementation-independent way. It preserves the **semantic intent** of business logic across different execution engines and orchestration platforms.

## Problem Statement

Modern business systems require:

- **Declarative business process definitions** that are independent of execution engines
- **Semantic preservation** of business intent across system boundaries
- **Composability** of business flows from reusable components
- **Observability** of business process execution and state transitions
- **Governance** of business rules and policies within processes

Current solutions (BPMN, workflow engines, orchestration platforms) often:
- Lock users into specific vendors or platforms
- Mix business semantics with implementation details
- Lack standardized event and state models

## Maturity

OBC is **DRAFT** for v0.0.1. Breaking changes are allowed. Schemas may tighten further in minor or major releases.

# registry/ (Discovery)

Discovery and index files for OKHAM contracts.

This directory is used by tooling (and sometimes by sites/services) to:
- list available contracts
- resolve latest/stable pointers
- drive automated validation and compatibility checks

Depending on your workflow, treat these files as **semi-normative** (they define what is published), but not as a replacement for the contract specs themselves.

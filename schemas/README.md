# schemas/ (Normative)

This directory contains the **canonical JSON Schemas** for OKHAM contracts.

These schemas are **normative** for structure/validation.

- Prefer pinned versions when consuming schemas.
- If using `latest`, state that explicitly.

Contract ids include (non-exhaustive): `otc`, `oec`, `oic`, `opc`, `onc`, `oucc`, and `oap` (application package manifest).

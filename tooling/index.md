# OKHAM Tooling Overview

This portal provides documentation for the tools that implement OKHAM standards.

> **Implementation Portal:** This site provides tools and registries that implement OKHAM definitions published at [okham.org](https://okham.org). Standards are defined at [okham.org](https://okham.org).

## Available Tools

- **[OKHAM Lint](../tooling/lint/README.md)**: A semantic linter for OKHAM contracts to ensure compliance with the Open Contract Document (OCD) meta-standard.
- **[Contract Validator](../tooling/validation/README.md)**: Tools for validating OTC types and OEC events at runtime.

## Getting Started

To use these tools, you should first be familiar with the standards defined in the [OKHAM Foundation](https://okham.org/doc/foundation/README.md).

For implementation-specific details, see our [Reference Implementations](../implementation/README.md).

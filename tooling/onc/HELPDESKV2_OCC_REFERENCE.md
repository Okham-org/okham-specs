# HelpdeskV2 OCC Navigation Reference (Descriptive)

This is a descriptive reference showing how a HelpdeskV2 capability would reference ONC without altering the OCC schema.

```yaml
ui:
  enabled: true
  navigation:
    ref: helpdeskv2.navigation@0.2.0
```

Notes:
- The ONC manifest is `helpdeskv2.navigation`.
- No OCC schema changes are implied or required.

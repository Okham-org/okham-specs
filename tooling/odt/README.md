# ODT — Open Design Tokens

**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Status**: DRAFT  
**Category**: Tooling & Format Standard

---

## Problem

Design tokens often live in product-specific formats that are hard to share across teams and tools. This creates drift between design intent, UI components, and accessibility requirements.

---

## Scope

ODT defines a **neutral token exchange format** for:
- Semantic color, typography, spacing, motion, and elevation tokens
- Token metadata (status, source, intent)
- References and aliasing across token sets

---

## Maturity

ODT is **DRAFT** for v0.0.1. Breaking changes are allowed. Schemas may tighten further in minor or major releases.
